## What are **CHANNELS** and **FILTERS**?

**CHANNELS** are containers of information and that is all they are. There are no boundaries on the kind of information they contain or if that information makes any perceptual difference to us as human observers. 

These *kinds of information* contained within channels are refered to hereafter as **FEATUTES**

**FILTERS** or **KERNELS** or **FEATURE EXTRACTORS** are well they are mathematical functions convert channels containing a particular set of features into channels containing another set of features. For example, the horizintal line kernel exemplified in the assignment code converts channels containing RGB ampliture features to channels containing horizontal edge amplitude features
